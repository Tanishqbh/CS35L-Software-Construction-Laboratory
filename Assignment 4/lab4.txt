Debugging a C Program
Setup: Getting the file
	cd Desktop/CS35L/assignment4
	wget https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring18/cs35L/assign/coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz
		-downloads the zipped file into the current directory
	tar -xzf coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz
		-unzips the downloaded file

Building Coreutils
	cd coreutils-with-bug
	./configure --profile=/u/cs/ugrad/raymondl/CS35L/assignment4/coreutilsbug
		-configures the installation so that it is in the correct directory
	make
		-attempting to compile and make the executables,prepare for installation
		-error:
		In file included from utimecmp.h:25:0,
	                 from utimecmp.c:25:	
		/usr/include/sys/stat.h:374:12: note: previous declaration of 'futimens' was here
	 	extern int futimens (int __fd, __const struct timespec __times[2]) __THROW;

	 	Makefile:659: recipe for target 'utimecmp.o' failed
		make[2]: *** [utimecmp.o] Error 1
		make[2]: Leaving directory '/w/home.17/cs/ugrad/raymondl/Desktop/CS35L/assignment4/coreutils-with-bug/lib'
		Makefile:775: recipe for target 'install' failed
		make[1]: *** [install] Error 2
		make[1]: Leaving directory '/w/home.17/cs/ugrad/raymondl/Desktop/CS35L/assignment4/coreutils-with-bug/lib'
		Makefile:419: recipe for target 'install-recursive' failed
		make: *** [install-recursive] Error 1

		-the error indicates that the function "futimens()" was already defined
	wget https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring18/cs35L/assign/coreutils.diff
		-download the patch file from the website
	cat coreutils.diff|patch -p0
		-apply the patch
	make
		-successfully compiles program code and creates executables
		-the renaming patch fixes the issue, because it changes the function name from "futimens" to "coreutils_futimens"

Reproducing the Bug
	-ran the commands on the assignment website
	-creates a temporary directory containing 3 files
	-runs the ls command from the buggy core utils directory
	$ tmp=$(mktemp -d)
	$ cd $tmp
	$ touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' wwi-armistice
	$ touch now
	$ sleep 1
	$ touch now1
	$ TZ=UTC0 ~/Desktop/CS35L/assignment4/coreutils-with-bug/src/ls -lt --full-time wwi-armistice now now1
		-output:
			-rw-r--r-- 1 eggert csfac 0 1918-11-11 11:00:00.000000000 +0000 wwi-armistice
			-rw-r--r-- 1 eggert csfac 0 2017-01-25 00:11:55.528846902 +0000 now1
			-rw-r--r-- 1 eggert csfac 0 2017-01-25 00:11:54.524820127 +0000 now
		-the file 'wwi-armistice' should be on the bottom, because it is the oldest file, not the newest
		
Using the Debugger
	gdb ~/Desktop/CS35L/assignment4/coreutils-with-bug/src/ls
		-open the GNU debugger and select the 'ls' executable in the directory
	info functions
		-lists the function names in all the c files
		-functions of interest
			-compare_atime()
			-compare_ctime()
			-compare_mtime()
			-sort_files()
	break sort_files
		-set a breakpoint at one of the functions - in this case, sort_files
	run -lt --full-time wwi-armistice now now1
		-run the program in the debugger with the following options and arguments
		-debugger will stop the program at the start of the 'sort_files' function
	step
		-step through the program line by line
	list
		-look at the lines around the current line
		-output:
			switch (time_type)
				func = sort_reverse ? rev_cmp_mtime : compare_mtime;
		qsort (files, files_index, sizeof *files, func);

		-the 'sort_files' function calls another function 'compare_mtime' or 'rev_cmp_mtime'
	kill
		-stop debugging, because we must set a new breakpoint
	clear
		-remove the first breakpoint
	break compare_mtime
		-set a breakpoint whenever the compare_mtime function is called
	run -lt --full-time wwi-armistice now now1
		-start the program again within GDB
		-will stop at the function call 'compare_mtime'
	step
		-step into the function
		-output:
			static int compare_mtime (V a, V b) { return cmp_mtime (a, b, xstrcoll); }
		-it looks like 'compare_mtime' calls another function 'cmp_mtime'
	step
	list
		-show lines around current line
		-output:
		static inline int
        timespec_cmp (struct timespec a, struct timespec b)
        {
          int diff = a.tv_sec - b.tv_sec;
          return diff ? diff : a.tv_nsec - b.tv_nsec;
        }

        -it looks like 'cmp_mtime' calls another function 'timespec_cmp', in the file 'timespec.h'
        -the issue is with the possibility of overflow, when 'b.tc_sec' is subtracted from 'a.tv_sec' 
        -if one of the values is extremely small, and the other value is extremely large, overflow will occur
    quit
    	-exit the debugger

Construct a Patch
	cd ~/Desktop/CS35L/assignment4
		-go back into the right directory
	cp ./coreutils-with-bug/lib/timespec.h .
		-copies the timespec header file into the current directory
	vim timespec.h
		-edit the new file
		-new function:
		static inline int
		timespec_cmp (struct timespec a, struct timespec b)
		{
		        if(a.tv_sec > b.tv_sec)
		        {
		                return 1;
		        }
		        else if(a.tv_sec < b.tv_sec)
		        {
		                return -1;
		        ]
		        else
		        {
		        return 0;
		        }
		}
	diff -u ./coreutils-with-bug/lib/timespec.h timespec.h > lab4.diff
		-creates a file 'lab4.diff' which is patch file in the form of a ChangeLog entry

Producing the Problem in Home Directory
	mkdir test
		-create a directory for testing the bug
	$ tmp=$(mktemp -d)
	$ cd $tmp
	$ touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' wwi-armistice
	$ touch now
	$ sleep 1
	$ touch now1
		-run the commands on the assignment page
	ls -lt
		-run the command
		-output:
			-rw-r--r-- 1 raymondl csugrad 0 Dec 17  2054 wwi-armistice
            -rw-r--r-- 1 raymondl csugrad 0 May  3 17:04 now1
            -rw-r--r-- 1 raymondl csugrad 0 May  3 17:04 now
        -SEASnet does not do well 
        -it appears that the SEASnet server interprets the timestamp of the 'wwi-armistice' as December 17th, 2054
        -the local file system uses time stamps that are based on the number of seconds since the file was created
        -however, there is difference between the local file system and the SEASnet server, and thus the sign bit of the file's timestamp is incorrectly translated
        -as a result, the machine interprets the timestamp of 'wwi-armistice' as something that is in the future
