Homework
1. In the first scenario, the resulting
network is still secure. Although someone
may be observing all the bytes going across
the network, they will not be able to decipher
the data, because it is encrypted. First, the
server sends the client a "challenge question"
that the client must decrypt using their
private key. Because, they do not have the
private key, the attacker cannot act as the
user, and thus the attacker cannot be validated.
Then, the communication between client and
server switches to session encryption, a
symmetric key pair. Data going back and forth
cannot be read by attackers, because it is
encrypted.

In the second scenario, the resulting network is
not secure. Because the attacker has access to
all of the user's keystroke, the attacker will
be able to retrieve the passphrase for the
private key when the user inputs it.

In the third scenario, the resulting network is
also not secure. If the attacker has access to
the USB drive that the user's computer is
booting off of, the attacker also has access to
the private key itself, as it is inside the USB
drive.

2. Just because the signatures match, does not
mean that the data is sent from the original
owner or developer. It is possible that an
outside attacker gains access to the symmetric
session key, modifies the transmitted data,
and resigns the data with the attacker's key.
This will bypass '--verify' because it only
checks to see if the signatures on the data
and the key match. A solution to this problem
would be to meet up personally with the owner
of the data and compare the fingerprints.
