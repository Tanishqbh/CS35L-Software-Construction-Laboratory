1. The patch improves the performance of 'ls' because it only considers the last argument and processes it. In the patch file, an 'if' statement is removed. Therefore, the 'ls' has better performance after the patch because it does not have to process the 'if' statement.
2. There may be problems with compatibility. For example, previous scripts that used the 'ls -aA' command would have different results.
3. Error:
	Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "./randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "./randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py", line 274, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq is empty
	IndexError: list index out of range

	The error results because the file is empty and the script expects a value to be inputted.

4. File "randline.py", line 65
