Creating Words and Assignment 2 File
cd /usr/share/dict
cat words|sort -o ~/Desktop/CS35L/assignment2/words
cd ~/Desktop/CS35L/assignment2
wget https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring18/cs35L/assign/assign2.html

cat assign2.html|tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
Outputs words and characters line by line. Takes the complement of the set 1, which is everything that is not an alphabetic character, and replaces it with set 2, which is a new line.

cat assign2.html|tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
Does the same thing as the previous command, but if the '\n' character us repeated, it will only output one instance of it.

cat assign2.html|tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort
Does the same thing as the previous command but outputs the words in alphabetical ('sorted') order.

cat assign2.html|tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u
Does the same thing as the previous command, but eliminates any repeated words/characters.

cat assign2.html|tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm - words
Outputs three columns. The first are the words unique to the assign2.html file. The second are the words unique to the words file. The third are the words common to both files. 

cat assign2.html|tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - words
Does the same thing as the previous command, but only outputs the first column.
